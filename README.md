###Summary and Directions

The game I created is called "Mouse and Cheese." The goal is to find the mouse and the
cheese that are randomly hidden in a dark room as fast as you can. When the game runs, you must click
start for it to begin. Once the game begins, the 'play' screen will show up as a dark room. There
is a flashlight that you can move around using the arrow keys in order to "shine a light" in the room
and see in the dark. Once you find the cheese or the mouse, click on it (mouse function) and it will disappear.
You must find both to win. To prevent players from winning by blindly clicking around the screen, mouse-traps
have been set in random locations around the room (signified by a red rectangle). When the player wins, 
the final screen will appear with confetti (using timer function) and your time score. If you lose it will
take you to a losing screen.

###Keyboard/Mouse commands

**Arrow keys:** (up, down, left, right): moves the square of light around the screen

**Mouse (left) click:** clicking start button begins game, clicking mouse (like the animal) 
makes it disappear, clicking cheese will make it disappear, (once both are clicked, game ends), 
clicking mouse-trap ends game

###Grade
I believe I deserve 90-100 points on this open-ended project. It satisfies all requirements, has a class object (Quad
and Button), has a timer function (confetti), keyboard listeners, and mouse listeners.
My program runs without errors, and is documented well. Finally, I think my game is interesting and well designed/
drawn out. I added lots of graphic details for the appearance of the scene.
